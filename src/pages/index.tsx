          Hello! I&apos;m a recent graduate, that is now ready to dive into the
          world of professional Software Engineering. I&apos;d like to think of
          myself as a creative person, who meets challenges with a smile.
          Working on complex and innovative projects excites me like few other
          things do. I&apos;m eager to work in a team with like-minded people,
          where I have the opportunity to learn and grow as a person. I have a
          passion for exploring new technologies, solving real-life problems
          with code and automation. <br />
          When I&apos;m taking a break from coding the next big thing, I like to
          enjoy a good time with my friends playing basketball, working on
          ourselves in the gym or competing in various video games as a team.
        </p>
